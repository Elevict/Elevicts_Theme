# Shade Sanctuary

A set of snippets that eventually turned into a full-fledged theme. Shade Sanctuary is what I dreamnt of when thinking of the ideal environment to write mathematics on. Inspired heavily by [this wonderful guy](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) along with CyanVoxel's [Vauxhall theme](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/vauxhall-obsidian). It combines the best aspects of latex-like typing with the asthetics of the vibrant city night.

Additionally with the Style Settings plugin, Shade Sanctuary can have more theme color variations, theme intensities, colored sidebar folders, custom mathematics callouts, and an animated wave background.
