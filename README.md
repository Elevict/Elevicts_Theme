# Elevicts Theme

A minimalist theme I use to write mathematics on. Inspired heavily by [this wonderful guy](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/).

- Computer Modern Font

- Supports various callouts
  - guiding question
  - theorem
  - example
  - corollary
  - proposition
 
- Distribute and change as you please
