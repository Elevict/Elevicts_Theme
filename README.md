## Overview

Shade Sanctuary is a theme for Obsidian MD, designed to create an enjoyable environment for writing and working with mathematical content. It combines a sleek, modern look with the clarity of the *Computer Modern* font.

Inspired by [Castel's lecture notes](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) and CyanVoxel's [Vauxhall theme](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/vauxhall-obsidian), Shade Sanctuary blends the academic feel with colorful visuals.
